Containers are becoming increasingly popular in private cloud environments. For example, Google alone starts every week more than two billion containers. Containers supports effective software packaging and effective utilization of computers. Modern container engines, like Docker, simplify the composition and management of applications. These features make containers ideally suited to build modern cloud-native applications. 

The security of containers is, however, insufficient when containers from multiple cloud tenants must be protected when running in public or hybrid clouds and even in private clouds: for example, software vulnerabilities in the operating system can be exploited to access information in other containers. In addition, service developers must protect the confidentiality and integrity of data against accesses from all other parties, including the cloud provider itself. 

The new Intel SGX CPU extension introduces the concept of a secure enclave which permits to protect code and data from accesses by other software, even when accessed by higher-privileged system software. We use SGX for a secure container infrastructure on top of Docker: all data at rest (e.g., on disk), in transmission (e.g., via Ethernet), and also during processing (e.g., by a web services) is encrypted and protected from unauthorized accesses. 
The SCP project will use this SGX-based secure container technology - which are currently at level TRL3 (experimental proof of concept) and extend this technology to TRL 7. The main objective is to evaluate the technology in an operational environment and ensure that the software satisfies all requirements needed in operational environments.  We will evaluate this pilot in the following three contexts: 1) two flagship applications by partners SYNC and EXUS, and 2) a trial of the SCP container platform with SMEs.
